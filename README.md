# AMoD
Autonomous Mobility On-Demand Using Deep Learning

Getting Started
----------------

This AMoD Model should be run with [AMoD Simulator](https://github.com/idsc-frazzoli/amod). It was part of NIPS 2018 Challenges and was developed by the Institute of Dynamic Systems and Control at ETH Zürich in collaboration with the Institute for Transport Planning and Systems at ETH Zürich. We give many thanks to their effort. 

Once AMoDeus™ has been configured and AidoHost is launched properly, launch `AidoGuest.py` to begin dispatching. 

This model is based on Pytorch, and have enabled GPU acceleration if available.
